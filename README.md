# python-zero-to-mastery
## About
In this repo, I want to explore more about Python programming language. I will discuss 
hot-topic and useful libraries in this programming language, so you can have a deep understanding of 
whereabouts of this language. Python is really vast, so I will try to update it time to time. Thanks.

## Remarks
### 1. Logging
You can find the log files in both `logs/app.log` or `./app.log` for outputs.
