    "At first, we should learn the difference between these terms: `concurrency` and `parallelism`:\n",
    "- `Concurrency`: Concurrency is about dealing with multiple tasks at once but not necessarily doing them simultaneously. It gives the `illusion of parallelism` by switching between tasks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Parallelism`: Parallelism is executing multiple tasks simultaneously, leveraging multicore processors to perform computation-heavy tasks in `parallel`.\n",
